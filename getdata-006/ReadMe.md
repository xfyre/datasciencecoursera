=== How it works ===
This script takes experimental data, merges training and test data sets and calculates
means for each test subject and each activity.

As per project specification, only mean() (mean values) and std() (standard deviation values) 
are included in the output data set.

Please refer to the features_info.txt file in project data for further explanations of the 
output data set variables.

1. Download project data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Extract the archive
3. Put R script into extracted archive directory
4. Run R script. It will generate output.txt file containing tidy data set as project requires
